                <p>I got a LibreSDR B210 mini, and i cannot for the life of me get this thing to work. Like I can understand not working on arch because who cares abt arch, but even trying on this rpi 4 it refuses to work. I'm making a small server pc so I'll put windows on that and see if I can't get it working that way; the docs have a section on windows so maybe that will work better :p.</p>
                <p>uhh in other news just listened to the new <a href="https://youtu.be/TkXAe5sbZB8?si=rthOQywVIrrnYomK">Flavour Foley</a> and LORD they just keep making peak again and again. Also <a href="https://youtu.be/YreLAuvJdN0">this</a> cute video is just aaaaaaa!!</p>

                <p>oooooo baby shes pretty damn good! <img src="ublogResources/2025/meteormn2-3-20251228.png" alt=""> a very low noise floor compared to the Hackrf I was using, and I could even pick images of Greenland (top of the image), which is a first for me! (I could probably get it to reach into north africa too, but my timing was poor and it was a lower elevation pass :p ).</p>
                <p>The next move is to finalise the rotator firmware and finally build a lightweight dish for L-band, but that will have to wait until april-june. The future is promising!</p>

                <p>I've moved onto fixing the rotator for the L-Band Dish that I was working on over the summer. It's based on the <a href="https://wiki.satnogs.org/SatNOGS_Rotator_v3">Satnogs Rotator V3</a>, but I've made changes to the mechanics because I dont have some of the parts on hand.</p>
                <p>For some reason the code in the repo had issues with the easycomm v2 implementation, so I'm having to go in and troubleshoot it T_T</p>
                <p>In other news the power supply for my new server pc is arriving today, so I can finish building it later!</p>

                <p>The power supply finally arrived for my server and after hacking out a hole in the case for the power cable, shes up and running! <img src="ublogResources/2026/proxmox112026.png" alt=""> She's running on a Ryzen 5 5600GT, and the cheapest DDR4 ram I could find rn :p. Right now It's just a NAS, but I'll probably put jellyfin or something on it, depending on connection speed.</p>

                <p><i>mm this site has been updated a lot since the last post, but no μblog posts. Maybe we got it both ways?</i></p>
                <p>I MISS SPRING AND SUMMER!!!!! I genuinely haven't seen the sun or a blue sky in TWO WEEKS I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE</p>
                <p>I know I wont be saying this the moment it goes over 25 degrees but I think constantly striving for something is a good way to live your life, even if its just for a sunny day :,(</p>
