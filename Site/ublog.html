                <p>I got a LibreSDR B210 mini, and i cannot for the life of me get this thing to work. Like I can understand not working on arch because who cares abt arch, but even trying on this rpi 4 it refuses to work. I'm making a small server pc so I'll put windows on that and see if I can't get it working that way; the docs have a section on windows so maybe that will work better :p.</p>
                <p>uhh in other news just listened to the new <a href="https://youtu.be/TkXAe5sbZB8?si=rthOQywVIrrnYomK">Flavour Foley</a> and LORD they just keep making peak again and again. Also <a href="https://youtu.be/YreLAuvJdN0">this</a> cute video is just aaaaaaa!!</p>
